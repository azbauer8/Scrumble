// TODO: add keybind hook that runs on startup
// TODO: Add keyboard shortcuts for saving and opening new files
// TODO: add check for unsaved file when closing window - think this needs to be a global event listener

// TODO: Add indent/unindent functionality with tab/shift+tab
// TODO: Add custom context menu like Typora that acts as toolbar/bubble menu - used to modify selected content. Slash menu creates new content "template"

// TODO: Add slash menu
// TODO: Maybe opt to remove menu dropdown on Mac and just put all the functions in the native menu bar instead
